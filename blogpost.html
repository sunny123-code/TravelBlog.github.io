                The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the
                Old French word travail, which means 'work'.[2] According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first
                known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle
                English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French
                travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).

                In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon
                Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even
                more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes",
                as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in
                modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the
                Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can
                also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by
                bullock cart.[3]




                Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer
                homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended to be slower, more
                dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many
                years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.[9] Mankind has come a long
                way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an
                expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where
                aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.

                Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and
                to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or
                sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from
                village to hamlet, gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral
                support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far
                and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European
                and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and
                internationally.[10]

                In the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class
                men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This
                was known as the Grand Tour, it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome.
                However, The French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.[8]

                Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a
                network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started
                around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging
                task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and
                hotels were booked together.[11] Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance
                surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both
                aircraft and pilots.[8] Indeed, air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman,
                Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.[12]
